Display WordPress.org reviews of any plugin on your site.

== Description ==

**Updated!** _Plugin Reviews_ is finally updated and working with the latest versions of WP, PHP, etc. It's now maintained by [Starfish WP Plugins](https://starfishwp.com). So use it confidently, and look for new features in the future.

A tiny plugin to help you **showcase your WordPress.org reviews on your site**. It offers two different layouts: grid and carousel.

Simply provide your plugin's slug (on WordPress.org) and the plugin will fetch the reviews, and display them. For instance, if you want to get the reviews for this plugin, the slug is `plugin-reviews`.

By default, all reviews from WordPress.org are cached for 24 hours.

= Demo =

You can see it working here on the [Starfish Plugin Reviews page](https://starfishwp.com/plugin-reviews/). We use the Carousel Layout.

= Roadmap =

We're pretty busy, so feel free to contribute if you like the plugin :)

No promises, but things we'd like to add include:

* Make carousel options available from within the shortcode (items to show, items to scroll, duration, etc.)
* Make it work with AJAX to avoid long page load (for the first call to the API)
* Add styling options for grid?
* Add styling options for carousel?
* Add a way to disable style completely
* Add a way to change the prefix from `wr-` to `whatever` (applies to every elements)
* Loading carousel styles & scripts only if chosen layout is carousel
* Register modules for popular pagebuilders like Divi, Beaver Builder, Visual Composer, etc
* Add Gutenblocks compatibility (whenever Gutenberg is ready for that)

We're busy, so feel free to contribute!

== Installation ==

Go to Plugins>Add New and search "Plugin Reviews". Click "Install Now" then "Activate" on this plugin (by "Starfish Plugins").

There is no settings page. Use the shortcode:

`
[wr_reviews plugin_slug="plugin-slug-here"]
`

Change "plugin-slug-here" to the slug of the plugin you want to display the reviews for. The shortcode can be used anywhere on your site, and even on multiple pages/posts. There are a number of shortcode parameters you can also use,  [listed here](https://github.com/StarfishWP/Plugin-Reviews/wiki/Shortcode-Attributes).
